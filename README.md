# AUCTION-APP

## Final product :
    Android application for bidding system using WiFi-Direct
    
### Abstract :
    **-->** The Auction system is a model where we participate in a bid for products and services. While the online system doesn't provide a fair chance to the users with poor internet access, it also has other drawbacks such as single point of failure, expensive servers and many more. The existing P2P systems aim to remove these limitations.
    **-->** While the existing systems eliminate the above drawbacks by forming a peer-to-peer group in a local Wi-Fi network of connected devices, they fail to address the issue which causes unnecessary or excessive broadcasts in the system. 
    **Our project eliminates all of these drawbacks by preventing the query flooding and hence achieving low latency.**
